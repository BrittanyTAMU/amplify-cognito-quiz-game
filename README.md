**My Quiz App :)**

The application project leverages React, Node.js, AWS Amplify, and AWS Cognito to develop an educational tool aimed at scholars, offering intuitive and functional features for studying and memorization.

**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, React, Node.js.

The quiz app is constructed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and React/Node.js for functionality. Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are integrated into the React/Node.js codebase to create modular and reusable components. Event listeners capture user input, and dynamic manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) updates the quiz app display. CSS ensures visually appealing and responsive design across various devices.

**Lessons Learned:**
**User-Centric Approach**: Optimizing the project underscores the importance of considering the end user's experience. Prioritizing optimizations that enhance usability, accessibility, and overall satisfaction reinforces the significance of a user-centric design approach. I aim to further enhance these applications by integrating ML (Machine Learning) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies. For instance, after a user answers a question incorrectly, the AI could generate a follow-up question based on the previous incorrect response, reinforcing key concepts. Leveraging ML and real-life data has the potential to significantly improve accuracy and effectiveness.
